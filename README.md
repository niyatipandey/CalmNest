# 🌿 CalmNest – A Mental Wellness Website

**CalmNest** is a calming multi-page website focused on improving emotional wellbeing.  
It offers easy-to-access guidance for those struggling with sleep, overthinking, or stress.

This was built as part of my **first-ever hackathon experience**, where I set out to create something that feels warm, intentional, and helpful — even with simple tools and a beginner’s understanding.
